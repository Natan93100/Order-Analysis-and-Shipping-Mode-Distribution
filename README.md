# Nathan Ben David - Data Analyst Portfolio
## About

Hi! I'm Nathan, a young motivated Data Analyst looking for his next endeavor.<br>A lil about me before we jump to qualifications and so;
I like Data, Seriously, i Do!<br>
I Enjoy going on to [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/learn) every now and then, exploring a random data set,
analysing it, and come up with my own conclusions regarding it; Sometimes i'll even have business ideas based solely on the SQL analysis of the database.<br>
Besides that weird hobby of mine (right?!), I enjoy statsitics (especially weird correlations like in here : [tylervigen.com](https://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations))
and the Brain Science Field (if you do also, I HIGHLY encourage you to give 'The Brain That Changes Itself a read) as well as modelling data regarding that field using TensorFlow and Scikit-learn Libraries in Python.<br>
professionaly speaking, I hold a B.sc in Data-Science; During my studies, I gained the ability to work with complex data and developed an eye for identifying patterns and trends.<br> I also gained experience in laboratory techniques, data management, and statistical analysis, which I believe will be valuable assets in my role as a data analyst.<br>
Besides my acadmic knowledge and tools, I also have a proffesional background in working as a data analyst where I gained most of my knowledge, skills and tools.
## Skills used:
- **Advanced SQL**: Data manipulation, complex joins, and query optimization
- **Statistics**: Hypothesis testing, regression analysis, and probability
- **Tableau**: Data visualization, interactive dashboards, and storytelling

**Goal:**<br>
The goal of this code is to analyze order trends and customer preferences by:

1. Tracking monthly order volumes by region to understand when and where sales are highest.<br>
2. Highlighting the top-performing regions each month to help focus on areas with the strongest demand.<br>
3. Assessing customer preferences in shipping modes by calculating the proportion of orders using each mode.<br>
<br>

**Description:**<br> 
This project explores job postings across various industries to uncover key trends in the job market.<br> The analysis focuses on salary trends, the relationship between job roles and skills, and the demand for specific technical competencies.<br> By leveraging a comprehensive database of companies, job postings, and skill requirements, the project offers valuable insights into which skills are highly sought after, potential salary expectations, and how these factors vary across different companies.<br>
