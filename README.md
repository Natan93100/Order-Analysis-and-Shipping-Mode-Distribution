# Nathan Ben David - Data Analyst Portfolio
## About

Hi! I'm Nathan, a young motivated Data Analyst looking for his next endeavor.<br>A lil about me before we jump to qualifications and so;
I like Data, Seriously, i Do!<br>
I Enjoy going on to [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/learn) every now and then, exploring a random data set,
analysing it, and come up with my own conclusions regarding it; Sometimes i'll even have business ideas based solely on the SQL analysis of the database.<br>
Besides that weird hobby of mine (right?!), I enjoy statsitics (especially weird correlations like in here : [tylervigen.com](https://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations))
and the Brain Science Field (if you do also, I HIGHLY encourage you to give 'The Brain That Changes Itself a read) as well as modelling data regarding that field using TensorFlow and Scikit-learn Libraries in Python.<br>
professionaly speaking, I hold a B.sc in Data-Science; During my studies, I gained the ability to work with complex data and developed an eye for identifying patterns and trends.<br> I also gained experience in laboratory techniques, data management, and statistical analysis, which I believe will be valuable assets in my role as a data analyst.<br>
Besides my acadmic knowledge and tools, I also have a proffesional background in working as a data analyst where I gained most of my knowledge, skills and tools.
## Skills used:
- **Advanced SQL**: Data manipulation, complex joins, and query optimization
- **Statistics**: Hypothesis testing, regression analysis, and probability
- **Tableau**: Data visualization, interactive dashboards, and storytelling

**Goal:**<br>

   The goal of this code is to analyze order trends and customer preferences by:

1. Tracking monthly order volumes by region to understand when and where sales are highest.<br>
2. Highlighting the top-performing regions each month to help focus on areas with the strongest demand.<br>
3. Assessing customer preferences in shipping modes by calculating the proportion of orders using each mode.<br>
<br>

**Description:**<br> 

This SQL code provides a detailed analysis of order data, focusing on monthly order trends, regional sales performance, and shipping mode preferences.<br>
It first aggregates orders by month and region, enabling the identification of volume trends across various locations.<br>
Additionally, it identifies the top-performing region each month, spotlighting key markets with the highest order counts.<br>
Finally, the code calculates the percentage distribution of orders by shipping mode using Common Table Expressions, revealing customer preferences for different delivery options.
